# How to build accessible web forms

##About this repo
One of my assignments that I had to complete while at Dev Academy was to present a lightning talk on a tech topic. I chose to do my presentation on the topic of accessible web forms. 

##Key Files
Index4.html - the example form HTML
css/main.css - the form style 

##How to build accessible web forms - a checklist
*As part of my presentation, I developed a simple checklist to make building accessible web forms easier for any web developer. I believe everyone has the right to access information, services and communities on the internet. And web forms are the digital bridge to all of these things so it's essential they are accessible to all!* 

###Tick these off to check your form's accessibility
[ ] - I have used semantic HTML
[ ] - have used ARIA attributes where HTML may be unclear
[ ] - have made sure that form labels can be easily associated with inputs by providing a 'for' attribute on my label tag that matches the name and id attribute on my input tag.
[ ] - I have used <fieldset> and <legend> tags to group data
[ ] - I have added contrasting focus indicators to inputs and buttons
[ ] - I have checked form labels are easy to understand
[ ] - I have checked placeholders are visible and helpful
[ ] - I have identified *required* fields so that they are clear to the user
[ ] - My form displays helpful error messages if the wrong input is provided
[ ] - I have checked that a user can tab through the form fields in the correct order
